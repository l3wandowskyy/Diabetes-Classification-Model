# Diabetec-Classification-Model

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic medical measurements. The classification model can be a tool to support medical diagnosis, contributing to early detection of diabetes and timely medical interventions. 
### Technical Approach
The project involved extensive data preprocessing, which included converting all data types to numeric values. This process addressed miscoded data originally formatted as short dates rather than numerical values, in addition to handling missing values and outliers. Standardization was applied to ensure uniformity across the dataset, which enhanced algorithm convergence. The dataset was split into training and test sets in a ratio of 80:20. Several machine learning models were employed and evaluated, including K-NN as the baseline, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Each model was assessed using various metrics such as cross-validation, accurancy, precision, recall and F1-score. The model with the highest F1-score was ultimately selected as the optimal choice.
### Challenges Faced
During project work, challenges included selecting the most appropriate model and optimizing parameters. In addition, a key challenge was the appropriate interpretation of the results.
